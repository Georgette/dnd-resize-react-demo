# dnd-resize-react-demo
Drag and Drop with Resizable Components demo using react.js

This was a rapid prototype ( < 1 week ) to make a resizable grid system for a WYSWYG editor, and first dive into react/flux. 
This code was integrated into an old LAMP stack, and built upon. 

Working demo hosted through dropbox (keep in mind this is highly unpolished, but you can mouse over the borders of the droppables and resize them)
